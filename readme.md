# Multilayer Perceptron from scratch

## Presentation

This project aim to help me understanding how IA works. That's why I choosed to use only numpy and math.

The final goal is to create an IA capable of detecting the number draw in a 28 x 28 square (data provided by [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)).

## File

Here is the list of the file in this project and what are they used for :

- classe.py (This file contain all of the class and function used for the IA specifically)

- uniquePerceptron.py (This file contain a program to train and test the IA using only 1 neurones for a linear problem)

- layerTest.py (This file contain a program to train and test the IA using more than 1 layer of neurones for a more complex (XOR) problem)

- numberDetection.py (This file contain the code to train and test the IA in number detection)

- UI.py (Use this file to see the number wich are given to the IA)
